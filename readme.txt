This folder contains script files (of Matlab, pde2path (using Matlab), and AUTO (using python and C)) for simulations and data analysis, used in the paper "High-integrity human intervention in ecosystems: Tracking self-organization modes".

The three main script files to run are (for simulations of grazing management model, simulations of vegetation rehabilitation model, and for data analysis, respectively):
1) GrazingManagement.m
2) VegetationRehabilitation.m
3) RemoteSensingAnalysis.m

For the first two script files, you need to have the RDM library installed (https://github.com/yzelnik/RDM)
